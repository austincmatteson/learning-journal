# Learning Journal Day 2

Today my biggest hurdle was getting used to the triple equal sign, aka ===.
Or perhaps more honestly, it was hard for me to stop using ==.
I could see the major difference. How === works in absolutes and == results in type coercion.
But instilling in myself the practice of never using == and working with things like parseInt() instead was a hard.
I had some previous bias' from messing around with code a long time ago without any real guidance that made this my obstacle for today. 
But by the end of lecture I felt like it made sense.
I could start to identify why == could result in bad practice. 
And with the lab, I started to break my habits.
Practice makes perfect right?
